# [weicalc-gui](https://github.com/cheekur-coders/weicalc-gui) - Weibull Calculator GUI

Welcome to the [weicalc-gui](https://github.com/cheekur-coders/weicalc-gui) wiki by [@cheekur-coders](https://github.com/cheekur-coders)! [weicalc-gui] is a simple GUI program built with C and Windows API to calculate reliability statistics based on Weibull distribution. The goal is to help [@cheekur-coders](https://github.com/cheekur-coders) with learning C programming, software engineering and at the same time creating a simple and useful calculator. The advantage of using C is to ensure a quick calculator with the least amount of dependencies. The calculator is geared towards Weibull distribution as that is the most common distribution in the Reliability Engineering realm. The code is generated based on a lot of back-end work done to document the requirements and the pertaining program design. An effort has been made to document the entire process of creating this software. 

## Project Description
[weicalc-gui](https://github.com/cheekur-coders/weicalc-gui) is a simple C based Windows GUI application that calculates the following reliability statistics based on the expected life, life unit, beta and eta input by the user.
- Failure rate
- Bx% life
- Reliability after usage (needs usage life input)
- Unrealibility after usage (needs usage life input)
